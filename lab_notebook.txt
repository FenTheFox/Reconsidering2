LibMallocTrace
	used static mmaped buffer to satisfy dlsym's requests before malloc_ptr etc have been initialized
		this works because the path for RTLD_NEXT does not require an allocation -> probably because libc is already loaded(?)
	macros are a nice way to avoid duplicated code (decl and init of all func ptrs)
	sources are stored at /usr/src/debug

LibMallocTrace
	#include <execinfo.h> for programatic backtraces
	free can be called with a null ptr :(
