slabs.{c,h}
Slabs are up to 1MB and are divided into chuncks
each slab has one chunck size
chunk size ranges from sizeof(struct item) + sizeof(key) + sizeof(value) to 1/2 maximum slab size growing multiplicitavely by N (chunk sizes are powers of N)
last slab sz is 1MB
objects can be allocated and freed

items.c:
	includes replacement/LRU code

replacement:
	replacing the alocator itself will be easy, keep track of slab id for allocated pointers
	only dificulties will be with (prevets simple drop in replacement of slabs.c):
		maintaining max allocated amount and retuning null once we reach that amout
		keeping stats for each slab
