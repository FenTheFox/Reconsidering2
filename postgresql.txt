pool allocator (pool = memory context)
allows realloc and free on allocated pointers
also has notion of parent and child contexts, allows cleanup of entire tree of contexts
also allows attachment of arbitrary fuctions to a memory context that get called before reset/delete (like a c++ distructor)

replacement strategy:
	keep list of pointers that corespond to each pool, upon pool free free all of those pointers (same as nginx)
	keep parent, children of each context
